A MATLAB-based simulation tool designed to model and analyze projectile motion trajectories under varying input conditions. The project includes both a command-line MATLAB script and an interactive MATLAB App Designer application for user-friendly operation and visualization.

Project Overview:

This venture analyzes and simulates the movement of a projectile:
- an object is launched from coordinate A(x, y, z) with velocity 'V' at angle 'Î±'
- coordinate A is located at a distance 'D' from a tall building with height 'H'
- the object must land at location B, which is 10 meters away from the building on the x-axis, 5 meters away from the building on the y-axis, and 0 meters on the z-axis
- irrespective of the chosen coordinate A, the building location is always blocking the lin eof sight between A and B, since it is an obstacle
